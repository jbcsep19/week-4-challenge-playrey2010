    <h2><strong>The “Git” in GitHub</strong></h2>
    <p>To understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. Git is an open-source version control system
        that was started by Linus Trovalds—the same person who created Linux. Git is similar to other version control
        systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.

        So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When developers create something (an app, for
        example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official
        (non-beta) release.

        Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This
        allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and
        upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.

        Similarly, people who have nothing to do with the development of a project can still download the files and use
        them. Most Linux users should be familiar with this process, as using Git, Subversion, or some other similar
        method is pretty common for downloading needed files—especially in preparation for compiling a program from
        source code (a rather common practice for Linux geeks).

        Git is the preferred version control system of most developers, since it has multiple advantages over the other
        systems available. It stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better. If you’re
        interested in knowing the details, the Git Basics page has a thorough explanation on how Git works.</p>
